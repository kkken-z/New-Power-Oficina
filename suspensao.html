                <h3>Suspension</h3>
                <p>The suspension is one of the most important systems for the good performance and safety of your vehicle. She
                    is responsible for absorbing the impacts of terrain irregularities, providing smooth driving
                    smoother and more comfortable, in addition to maintaining the car's stability during the journey. When the
                    suspension is in good condition, you feel the difference in driving comfort and safety,
                    especially when cornering and braking.
                </p>
                <p>Composed of several components such as shock absorbers, springs, bushings and stabilizer bars, the
                    suspension has the function of keeping the tires in constant contact with the ground, which is crucial for the
                    vehicle stability. A well-calibrated suspension system also helps ensure wear and tear
                    uniformity of the tires, preventing them from wearing unevenly, which could affect grip and performance.
                    vehicle performance.</p>
                <p>Suspension maintenance must be done regularly, as the components in this part of the car are
                    exposed to constant wear due to factors such as the condition of the roads, the weight of the vehicle and the
                    driving style. Worn shock absorbers and springs can affect the car's ability to absorb
                    impacts and maintain stability, especially during sudden braking or when passing through holes and
                    speed bumps.</p>
                <p>In addition to improving comfort and safety, a well-maintained suspension can also impact
                    positively improve drivability and fuel consumption. This is because when the suspension
                    is not working properly, the car may become more difficult to control, requiring more
                    driver and engine effort to maintain speed and stability.</p>
                </p>
                <p>To ensure that your vehicle's suspension is always in perfect condition, it is important to carry out
                    periodic checks. If you notice that the car is having difficulty absorbing
                    impacts, if there are strange noises, if the steering is stiffer or if the car tends to "jump" more
                    than usual, it may be a sign that it is time to review the suspension system.</p>
                <p>Investing in preventive suspension maintenance is essential for your safety and comfort when driving.
                    drive. The team of qualified professionals will be ready to carry out the complete review and
                    ensure that your vehicle is always ready to face any road with confidence.</p>
